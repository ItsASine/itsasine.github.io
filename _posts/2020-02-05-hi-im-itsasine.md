# Hi, I'm ItsASine

To commemorate my 3 year mark on [dev.to](http://dev.to), I'm actually going to start *contributing* content by starting a tech blog

## Who I Am

- I've been around DEV for a while â€” mostly bookmarking articles I'll never read, but otherwise, I keep to the comments
- I have 5 years experience as a software test engineer
- My normal testing stack is Selenium, Jasmine, and Protractor
- I tend not to end single sentences with punctuation
- I recently got a master's degree in applied mathematics
    - or, I'm a certified mathemagician
- I've overly planned how this will go so that I don't fizzle out after 3 posts
    - It'll be more like 15 posts instead, starting with this one :D
- I'm a DEV mod and tag mod of a bunch of things, so you may have seen me around acting like I'm official and stuff like a hall monitor

## What to Expect

Most of my plans for posts revolve around acceptance testing, as that's where my professional experience is and that's somewhat underrepresented in tech blogs.

Some ideas I have:

- Actual technical posts such as how to test a CSV's contents in Node or what the difference is between Protractor element selectors
- Technical opinion posts, like best practices and how devs' tests differ from a QA's tests
- Other components of testing a webapp, like using automation on a cloud service's devices

Right this second, all this is stored in Notion so I stay motivated and can write anywhere:

I'll be using Repl to show actual examples in Jasmine where things aren't Selenium/Protractor specific. I might use something like CodeSandbox for full running Selenium/Protractor examples, but I need to get that set up first. If anyone has any other suggestion for embedding a headed Node process somewhere, I'm all ears.

So yeah... just wanted to give a heads up that another QA blog is getting started. Follow me on DEV if you want to join the ride :D
